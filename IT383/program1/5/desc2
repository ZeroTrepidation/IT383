The first c file is shm_filesender. This process is responsible for creating the shared memory
and uploading file to the shared memory. The first thing I do for this program was initialize all
of my variables and create the struct that will be laid on top of the shared memory. After that
I then create the pointer that will be assigned to the mmap() and then open a shared memory space
using the shm_open() system call. This will create the space itself. Once the space is open
ftruncate() is used to set the size of the the shared memory and then the struct is laid on top of
memory using the mmap() function. AFter the stuct is laid on top of the memory I then start to
assign values to all of the variables within shared memory, e.g flag, name, and size. Once that is
done do while loop and for loop is used to write the file to the contents. The file is then closed.

For the second file we also need to first initialize our variables. This includes the filesharing_struct
so that we have a way to reference the struct in the shared memory. Once that is done the shared
memory is opened using shm_open() with read permissions and then the pointer is mapped. Once the
pointer is mapped i simply check the flag within the memory to see if there is a file and if
there is a file then I perform the operation intended. The first thing i do is prompt the user
for the name of the file that needs to be printed to and then I print out the size and the name.
Afterwards the contents of the shared memory is written to the new file and then once this is
 completed the shared memory is deleted using the shm_unlink() system call.
