Once I realized that there was a lot more to the second part of the
assignment than I originally thought, I realized that I would need to
redo a lot of my code. The first major change was I moved the buffer out of
the program as recommended by the book and declared this information
in a separate header file. After this I cleaned up both my producer and consumer
functions by extracting the locked actual insertion and deletion operations and
putting them in their own functions. In addition to making my program more readable
this gave me the ability to add error checking to my insertion and deletion methods.
Once my producer and consumer functions were written correctly I needed to edit
my main method. The first thing that i needed to do for this section was create
an array of strings and I did this by using malloc to dynamically allocate both
the array of strings and also the length of the strings within the array. I also
needed to add the ability for my program to open and read from a file which I did
by just using fgets and reading directly into the word array. Once I got the program
working with 1 of each thread I then tested the program with multiple threads and
then finally after that worked I implemented the larger word file. This file and
the size of the array that stores it were both hardcoded and If I wanted to modify
that in the future I believe the best way to do this is to just have a function
that checks to see if the array is too small and if so just double it's size.

Overall I really enjoyed this assignment and thought most of it was fairly
straightforward. In a sense the hardest part was ensuring that I used the double
pointer correctly for the array of strings since the other parts of the
assignment were similar to two of our past assignments in regards to creating a
producer and consumer and then using the java thread APIs.
